<P>
Chawan itself is dedicated to the public domain. However, it contains and
depends on projects with different licensing terms.
<P>
This document attempts to list licensing terms of projects included in
the Chawan repository. Note that Chawan is dynamically linked against
your copy of zlib, libcurl, your C library, and if exists, your termcap
library. For licensing terms of these, please consult the appropriate
library's documentation.
<P>
Also, Chawan is statically linked to the Nim standard library. At the time
of writing, (i.e. as of Nim 2.0.0,) this is the MIT license (same terms as
the vendored Punycode library).
