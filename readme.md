# twt - a web browser in your terminal

## What is this?
A terminal web browser. It displays websites in your terminal.

## Why make another web browser?
I've found other terminal web browsers insufficient for my needs. In fact, I started working on this after failing to add JavaScript support to w3m.

## So what can this do?
Currently implemented features are:
* basic html rendering (WIP)
* custom keybindings

Planned features:
* image (sixel/kitty)
* video (sixel/kitty)
* audio
* table
* cookie
* form
* JavaScript
* SOCKS proxy
* extension API (adblock support?)
* markdown? (with pandoc?)
* gopher?
* gemini?

## How do I configure stuff?
Currently only keybindings can be configured. See the keymap file for the default (built-in) configuration.
