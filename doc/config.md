# Configuration of Chawan

Chawan supports configuration of various options like keybindings, user
stylesheets, site preferences, etc. The configuration format is very similar
to toml, with the following exceptions:

* Inline tables may span across multiple lines.
* Table arrays can be cleared by setting a variable by the same to the
  empty array. This allows users to disable default table array rules.

Example:
```
omnirule = [] # note: this must be placed at the beginning of the file.

[[omnirule]] # this is legal. all default omni-rules are now disabled.
```

Chawan will look for a config file in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/chawan/ directory
called `config.toml`. (Chawan defaults to ~/.config if the XDG_CONFIG_HOME
environment variable is not set.) See the default configuration file in the
res/ folder, and bonus configuration files in the bonus/ folder for further
examples.

function exits. (Note however that asynchronous functions like setTimeout
do not block loading.)</td>

enabled when Chawan is called with -r.</td>

correctly.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>display-charset</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>Character set for keyboard input and displaying documents.<br>
Used in dump mode as well.<br>
(This means that e.g. `cha -I EUC-JP -O UTF-8 a > b` is equivalent to `iconv
-f EUC-JP -t UTF-8`.)</td>

## Omnirule

The omni-bar (by default opened with C-l) can be used to perform searches using

# Search using Wikipedia, Firefox-style.
[[omnirule]]
match = '^@wikipedia'
substitute-url = '(x) => "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=" + encodeURIComponent(x.replace(/@wikipedia/, ""))'
```

Omnirule options:

	const s = x.pathname.split('/');
	x.pathname = s.at(s.length > 2 ? -2 : 1);
	/* No need to return; URL objects are passed by reference. */
}
'''

# Allow cookie sharing on *sr.ht domains.
[[siteconf]]
host = '(.*\.)?sr\.ht' # either 'something.sr.ht' or 'sr.ht'
cookie = true # enable cookies
share-cookie-jar = 'sr.ht' # use the cookie jar of 'sr.ht' for all matched hosts
third-party-cookie = '.*\.sr\.ht' # allow cookies from subdomains
```

Siteconf options:

attacks. Please do not use this unless you are absolutely sure you know what you
are doing.</td>
</tr>

</table>

## Stylesheets

User stylesheets are to be placed in the `[css]` section.

There are two ways to import user stylesheets:

1. Include a user stylesheet using the format `include = 'path-to-user.css'`.
   To include multiple stylesheets, use `include = ['first-stylesheet.css,
   second-stylesheet.css']`.  
   Relative paths are interpreted relative to the config directory.

2. Place your stylesheet directly in your configuration file using `inline =
   """your-style"""`.  

## Keybindings

Keybindings are to be placed in these sections:

* for pager interaction: `[page]`
* for line editing: `[line]`

Keybindings are configured using the syntax

	'<keybinding>' = '<action>'

Where `<keybinding>` is a combination of unicode characters with or without
modifiers. Modifiers are the prefixes `C-` and `M-`, which add control or
escape to the keybinding respectively (essentially making `M-` the same as
`C-[`). Modifiers can be escaped with the `\` sign.

`<action>` is either a command defined in the `[cmd]` section, or a JavaScript
expression. Here we only describe the pre-defined actions in the default config;
for a description of the API, please see:

<!-- MANOFF -->
[the API documentation](api.md).
<!-- MANON -->
<!-- MANON
The API documentation at **cha-api**(5).
MANOFF -->

Examples:

```toml
# show change URL when Control, Escape and j are pressed
'C-M-j' = 'cmd.pager.load'
# go to the first line of the page when g is pressed twice without a preceding
# number, or to the line when a preceding number is given.
'gg' = 'cmd.pager.gotoLineOrStart'
```

Note: to facilitate URL editing, the line editor has a different definition
of what a word is than the pager. For the line editor, a word is either a
sequence of alphanumeric characters, or any single non-alphanumeric
character. (This means that e.g. `https://` consists of four words: `https`,
`:`, `/` and `/`.)

```Examples:
# Control+A moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
'C-a' = 'cmd.line.begin'

# Escape+D deletes everything after the cursor until it reaches a word-breaking
# character.
'M-d' = 'cmd.line.killWord'
```

## Appendix

### Regex handling

Regular expressions are currently handled using libregexp which is included in
QuickJS. This means that all regular expressions work as in JavaScript.

There are two different modes of regex preprocessing in Chawan: "search" mode,
and "match" mode. "match" mode is used for configurations (meaning in all values
in this document described as "regex"). "search" mode is used for the on-page
search function (using searchForward/isearchForward etc.)

#### Match mode

Regular expressions are assumed to be exact matches, except when they start
with a caret (^) sign or end with an unescaped dollar ($) sign.

In other words, the following transformations occur:

```
^abcd -> ^abcd (no change, only beginning is matched)
efgh$ -> efgh$ (no change, only end is matched)
^ijkl$ -> ^ijkl$ (no change, the entire line is matched)
mnop -> ^mnop$ (changed to exact match, the entire line is matched)
```

Match mode has no way to toggle JavaScript regex flags like `i`.

#### Search mode

For on-page search, the above transformations do not apply; the search `/abcd`
searches for the string `abcd` inside all lines.

"Search" mode also has some other convenience transformations:

* The string `\c` (backslash + lower-case c) inside a search-mode regex enables
  case-insensitive matching.
* Conversely, `\C` (backslash + capital C) disables case-insensitive matching.
  (Useful if you have `ignore-case` set to true, which is the default.)
* `\<` and `\>` is converted to `\b` (as in vi, grep, etc.)

Note that none of these work in "match" mode.

### Path handling

Rules for path handling are similar to how strings in the shell are handled.

* Tilde-expansion is used to determine the user's home directory. So
  e.g. `~/whatever` works.
* Environment variables can be used like `$ENV_VAR`.
* Relative paths are relative to the Chawan configuration directory.

Some internal variables are also defined by Chawan. These can be accessed using
the non-standard syntax `${%VARIABLE}`:

* `${%CHA_BIN_DIR}`: the directory which the `cha` binary resides in. Note
  that symbolic links are automatically resolved to determine this path.
* `${%CHA_LIBEXEC_DIR}`: the directory for all executables Chawan uses
  for operation. By default, this is `${%CHA_BIN_DIR}/../libexec/chawan`.

### Word types

Word-based pager commands can operate with different definitions of
words. Currently, these are:

* w3m words
* vi words
* Big words

#### w3m word

A w3m word is a sequence of alphanumeric characters. Symbols are treated
in the same way as whitespace.

#### vi word

A vi word is a sequence of alphanumeric characters, OR a sequence of symbols.

vi words may be separated by whitespace; however, symbolic and alphanumeric
vi words do not have to be whitespace-separated. e.g. following character
sequence contains two words:

```
hello[]+{}@`!
```

#### Big word

A big word is a sequence of non-whitespace characters.

It is essentially the same as a w3m word, but with symbols being defined as
non-whitespace.
