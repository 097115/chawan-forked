# Configuration of Chawan

Chawan supports configuration of various options like keybindings, user
stylesheets, site preferences, etc. The configuration format is very similar
to toml, with the following exceptions:

* Inline tables may span across multiple lines.
* Table arrays can be cleared by setting a variable by the same to the
  empty array. This allows users to disable default table array rules.

Example:
```
omnirule = [] # note: this must be placed at the beginning of the file.

[[omnirule]] # this is legal. all default omni-rules are now disabled.
```

Chawan will look for a config file in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/chawan/ directory
called `config.toml`. (Chawan defaults to ~/.config if the XDG_CONFIG_HOME
environment variable is not set.) See the default configuration file in the
res/ folder, and bonus configuration files in the bonus/ folder for further
examples.

enabled when Chawan is called with -r.</td>
</tr>

</table>

## Search

Search options are to be placed in the `[search]` section.

correctly.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>display-charset</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>Character set for keyboard input and displaying documents.<br>
Used in dump mode as well.<br>
(This means that e.g. `cha -I EUC-JP -O UTF-8 a > b` is equivalent to `iconv
-f EUC-JP -t UTF-8.)</td>

[page]
# Here, the arrow function will be called with the vi numbered prefix if
# one was input, and with no argument otherwise.

## Omnirule

The omni-bar (by default opened with C-l) can be used to perform searches using
omni-rules. These are to be placed in the table array `[[omnirule]]`.

Examples:
```
# Search using DuckDuckGo Lite. (Bound to C-k by default.)
[[omnirule]]
match = '^ddg:'
substitute-url = '(x) => "https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/?kp=-1&kd=-1&q=" + encodeURIComponent(x.split(":").slice(1).join(":"))'

# Search using Wikipedia, Firefox-style.
[[omnirule]]
match = '^@wikipedia'
substitute-url = '(x) => "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=" + encodeURIComponent(x.replace(/@wikipedia/, ""))'
```

Omnirule options:

<table>

<tr>
<th>**Name**</th>
<th>**Value**</th>
<th>**Function**</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>match</td>

<td>JavaScript function</td>
<td>A JavaScript function Chawan will pass the input string to. If a new string is
returned, it will be parsed instead of the old one.</td>
</tr>

</table>

## Siteconf

Configuration options can be specified for individual sites. Entries are to be
placed in the table array `[[siteconf]]`.

Examples:
```
# Enable cookies on the orange website for log-in.
[[siteconf]]
url = 'https://news\.ycombinator\.com/.*'
cookie = true

# Redirect npr.org to text.npr.org.
[[siteconf]]
host = '(www\.)?npr\.org'
rewrite-url = '''
(x) => {
	x.host = "text.npr.org";
	x.pathname = x.pathname.replace(/(.*)\/.*/, "$1").replace(/.*\//, "");
	/* No need to return; URL objects are passed by reference. */
}
'''

# Allow cookie sharing on *sr.ht domains.
[[siteconf]]
host = '.*sr\.ht'
cookie = true
share-cookie-jar = 'sr.ht'

false for all websites.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>third-party-cookie</td>
<td>regex/array of regexes</td>
<td>Domains for which third-party cookies are allowed on this domain. Note:
this only works for buffers which share the same cookie jar.<br>
Note: regexes are handled according to the [regex handling](#regex-handling)
rules.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>share-cookie-jar</td>
<td>host</td>
<td>Cookie jar to use for this domain. Useful for e.g. sharing cookies with
subdomains.</td>

siteconfs) are not overridden. (In other words, they will be concatenated
with this stylesheet to get the final user stylesheet.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>proxy</td>
<td>URL</td>
<td>Specify a proxy for network requests fetching contents of this buffer.</td>
</tr>


</table>

## Stylesheets

User stylesheets are to be placed in the `[css]` section.

There are two ways to import user stylesheets:

1. Include a user stylesheet using the format `include = 'path-to-user.css'`.
   To include multiple stylesheets, use `include = ['first-stylesheet.css,
   second-stylesheet.css']`.  
   Relative paths are interpreted relative to the config directory.

2. Place your stylesheet directly in your configuration file using `inline =
   """your-style"""`.  

## Keybindings

Keybindings are to be placed in these sections:

* for pager interaction: `[page]`
* for line editing: `[line]`

Keybindings are configured using the syntax

	'<keybinding>' = '<action>'

Where `<keybinding>` is a combination of unicode characters with or without
modifiers. Modifiers are the prefixes `C-` and `M-`, which add control or
escape to the keybinding respectively (essentially making `M-` the same as
`C-[`). Modifiers can be escaped with the `\` sign.

```
Examples:
'C-M-j' = 'pager.load()' # change URL when Control, Escape and j are pressed
'gg' = 'pager.cursorFirstLine()' # go to the first line of the page when g is pressed twice
```

An action is a JavaScript expression called by Chawan every time the keybinding
is typed in. If an action returns a function, Chawan will also call the
returned function automatically. So this works too:

```
U = '() => pager.load()' # works
```

Note however, that JavaScript functions must be called with an appropriate
this value. Unfortunately, this also means that the following does not work:

```
q = 'pager.load' # broken!!!
```

A list of built-in pager functions can be found below.

</table>

Some of these entries have an optional `bounds` parameter. If passed, this
must be a JavaScript function that expects one parameter (the current
unicode character), and returns true if the passed character should count
as a word boundary.

```Examples:
# Control+A moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
'C-a' = 'line.begin()'

# Escape+D deletes everything after the cursor until it reaches a word-breaking
# character.
'M-d' = 'line.killWord()'

# Control+W deletes everything before the cursor until it reaches a space. 
'C-w' = 'line.clearWord(x => x == " ")'
```

## Appendix

### Regex handling

Regular expressions are assumed to be exact matches, except when they start
with a caret (^) sign or end with an unescaped dollar ($) sign.

In other words, the following transformations occur:

```
^abcd -> ^abcd
efgh$ -> efgh$
^ijkl$ -> ^ijkl$
mnop -> ^mnop$
```
